I almost never get asked about what's my setup is or what I use. Nonetheless, here is what I use on daily basis.

## Coding Software

[[Brave]](https://brave.com/) - as my personal browser. I also use Chrome and sometimes Safari.

[[Replit]](https://replit.com/~) online IDE better than [[Visual Studio Code]](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - which in turn is better than notepad. :: PS {Mostly Replit}

[[12ft]](https://12ft.io/) - it removes the paywall & let's you read articles ; recommended by Paras Chopra. 

[[ListMonk]](https://listmonk.app/) - Self-hosted newsletter and mailing list manager.
